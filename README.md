C0-C3 Core Mechanism for Combustion
We followed a fundamental principle when we created the ThInK core mechanism: 
There is no fitting in this mechanism to any experimental bulk properties.
Instead, this mechanism is largely developed through ab initio kinetics calculations 
wherever additional thermochemical and kinetic parameters were needed.
