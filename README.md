# C0-C3 Core Mechanism
We followed a fundamental principle in creating the ThInK core mechanism for hydrocarbon combustion (C0-C3 fuels).
In particular, there is no fitting in this mechanism to any experimental bulk properties.
Instead, this mechanism is largely developed through ab initio kinetics calculations 
wherever additional thermochemical and kinetic parameters were needed.
